<h3>1. Bayes Classification</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Bayes Classification is based on Bayes' Theorem, providing a probabilistic approach to classification problems. It is particularly useful for tasks involving text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier, including examples and datasets for testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Decision Tree</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Decision Trees are non-parametric models that make decisions based on a series of questions about the features of the data. They are widely used for classification and regression tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Implementation of Decision Tree algorithms, along with pruning techniques and visualization tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Ensemble Learning</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Ensemble Learning combines multiple models to improve performance over individual models. Techniques like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking are covered here.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Implementation of popular ensemble methods such as Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine the likelihood that a given hypothesis is true. It's foundational in inferential statistics and is used to validate assumptions in machine learning models.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Examples of hypothesis tests (Z-test, T-test, Chi-square test) applied to various datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the 'k' nearest data points in the feature space and making predictions based on majority voting or averaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> KNN implementation with examples, hyperparameter tuning, and distance metric variations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. Linear Regression</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes. It models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using a linear equation.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Simple and multiple linear regression implementations, along with regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Logistic Regression</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is commonly used for binary classification problems.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Implementation of logistic regression with examples, including binary, multiclass, and regularized logistic regression.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. Random Forest Algorithm</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction. It is widely used for both classification and regression tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Implementation of Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance evaluation on various datasets.</li>
</ul>
